  <h4>Personal Assessment</h4>
  <p>Before designing your personal fitness program, I will conduct a thorough assessment of your current fitness level, including strength, cardiorespiratory capacity and flexibility.
  <br>
  Together we will set realistic goals to improve your health and physical fitness.
  <br>
  Based on your priorities, I will plan a series of workouts and adapt them to meet your needs.</p>

  <h4>Fitness Routines</h4>
  <p>I offer one-hour sessions in my home studio, your home or virtually.  Your workout will begin with a light cardio warmup and some dynamic stretching.
  <br>
  Then we will do a series of strength training exercises focused on your individual needs.
  <br>
  We will finish with some full body stretches that will leave you feeling physically and mentally energized.</p>

  <h4>Diet</h4>
  <p>We will meet for two or three one hour sessions to analyze your eating habits and dietary needs.
  <br>
  I will then support you in making nutritionally sound and practical changes that will lead to weight loss.
  <br>
  Rather than asking you to adhere to a rigid  diet we will develop individualized strategies to help you make lasting, healthy changes to your food choices.</p>
