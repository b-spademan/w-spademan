      <h4>Personal Assessment</h4>
      <div class="wide-view">
        <p>Before designing your personal fitness program, I will conduct a thorough assessment of your current fitness level, including strength, cardiorespiratory capacity, flexibility and body composition.
          <br><br>
        Together we will set realistic goals to improve your health and physical fitness.
        <br><br>
        Based on your priorities, I will plan a series of workouts and adapt them to meet your needs.</p>

    <div class="wrapper">
      <h4>Fitness Routines</h4>
      <div class="wide-view">
        <p>I offer one-hour sessions in my home studio, your home or virtually.  Your workout will begin with a light cardio warmup and some dynamic stretching.
        <br><br>
        Then we will do a series of strength training exercises focused on your individual needs.
        <br><br>
        We will finish with some full body stretches that will leave you feeling physically and mentally energized.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="wrapper blue">
      <h4>Diet</h4>
      <div class="wide-view">
        <p>We will meet for two or three one hour sessions to analyze your eating habits and dietary needs.
        <br><br>
        I will then support you in making nutritionally sound and practical changes that will lead to weight loss.
        <br><br>
        Rather than asking you to adhere to a rigid diet we will develop personalized strategies that will allow you to make lasting, healthy changes to your food choices.</p>

  <h5>Testimonials</h5>
  <p class="quote">"Wendy is a great personal trainer. Not only have I dropped 5 pounds but I feel great. Feeling inspired and motivated. Just spent 3 weeks up vacationing at Deanlea Beach and managed to keep those 5 pounds off. Thanks Wendy. I have learned so much from you in the last few months. Love working out with you."</p>
